                <h2>Early Conquest and Establishment</h2>
                <p>New Spain's history began with Hernán Cortés' conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521. Cortés and his small force, leveraging alliances with indigenous groups antagonistic to the Aztecs, managed to capture Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City), marking the start of Spanish rule. This conquest was brutal and marked by significant upheaval and transformation of the indigenous societies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain" target="_blank">(1)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Colonial Administration</h2>
                <p>The administrative structure of New Spain was designed to consolidate Spanish control over its vast territories. The viceroy, the king's chief representative, governed from Mexico City and had extensive but not absolute authority, working alongside councils such as the Audiencias. These institutions were instrumental in maintaining Spanish law and order across the colony <a href="https://historycooperative.org/new-spain" target="_blank">(2)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Economic Exploitation</h2>
                <p>New Spain's economy was heavily based on mining, particularly silver, which became the backbone of its wealth. Regions like Zacatecas and Guanajuato were renowned for their rich silver mines, significantly contributing to the Spanish Empire's finances. The encomienda system was established early on, granting Spanish settlers control over local indigenous populations to extract labor and tributes, often leading to severe exploitation and population decline among native peoples <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Viceroyalty-of-New-Spain" target="_blank">(3)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Cultural and Religious Impact</h2>
                <p>Spanish colonization deeply influenced the cultural and religious landscape of New Spain. The Catholic Church played a central role, with missions established throughout the territory to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity. This led to a syncretism of indigenous and Spanish religious practices, exemplified by traditions such as the Day of the Dead <a href="https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/year-8/new-spain/" target="_blank">(4)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Reforms and Decline</h2>
                <p>The 18th century saw the Bourbon Reforms, aimed at increasing efficiency and profitability of the colonies. These reforms included stimulating mining production, creating a more efficient bureaucracy, and attempting to reduce the power of the local Creole elite. However, these changes often led to social unrest and resistance from both indigenous populations and Creoles <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/latin-america-and-caribbean/mexican-history/new-spain" target="_blank">(5)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Independence</h2>
                <p>The early 19th century brought significant turmoil to New Spain, exacerbated by events in Europe such as the Napoleonic Wars. In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the Mexican War of Independence, which culminated in 1821 with the establishment of an independent Mexico. This marked the end of New Spain as a Spanish colony, transitioning to a new era of self-governance and national identity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain" target="_blank">(1)</a>.</p>
